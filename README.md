# Project Name
Project 5 for MSCH-C220, 12/8

In this 3D game, the player must escape a space station by avoiding an alien creature and reaching the exit before the countdown finishes. It includes dialogue, a maze of corridors, an enemy AI, and an ending animation.

## Implementation
* Player movement controls
* Complex maze level design
* Custom radio asset made in blender, animated and interactable
* Custom CSG glass and donut display pillar
* Custom alien enemy made in blender, with animations and AI
* A countdown timer affecting lose and win state
* Dialogue plays upon entering region - when finished, enemy approaches faster
* Particles and emissive custom texures
* Retro PS1 post-processing shader through viewport
* Origional in-game music
* Sound effects - alien footsteps, radio zap, ship explosion
* Animation for ship destruction
* HUD - pause menu, main menu, controls, lose and win text

## What Makes this a Game?
This game has a clear objective and instructions for the player to follow, which encourages them to develop competence for how to play. There are different routes that can be taken to beat the maze and different strategies for avoiding the monster (getting it caught behind glass or using the radio to delay it) which allows for autonomy. The game also has a story component with dialogue and ending text which gives more information about the world so that the player can feel more immersed and related to the situation.

## Future Development
I would like to add a more complex alien AI so that there was more suspense and tension. I need to add a cooldown timer on the radio so that the player cannot spam it. I also wanted to add some sort of animation for stunning the alien. I think the story could be expanded upon more, and the player could have interacted with the dialogue somehow.
